# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
# Project Overview
With the rapid expansion of the telecommunications industry, customer retention has become a critical focus. It is significantly more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. This project uses data analytics and machine learning to understand customer behavior and predict churn â€” whether a customer is likely to leave the service.

Description: Each row in the dataset represents a customer, and each column contains attributes like tenure, service usage, billing information, and whether or not they churned.

Key Features:
customerID: Unique customer identifier

gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines

InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup

DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies

Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod

MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

Churn: Target variable
